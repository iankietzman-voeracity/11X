# 11x Mendel 

## Service Description and Philosophy
Mendel is currently the least developed of the 11x services. Python is of course renowned for its speed of development, so I chose to focus there for the initial round of building. This service is envisioned as a place to move computationally expensive operations that are likely to outgrow the Python ecosystem -- with the artifically small mock data of one sample and two lanes totalling approximately ~1500 reads spread across two sets of two files (R1, R2) the current iteration works well, clocking in around 60ms to fully process. But of course scaling that data up toward more realistic real world levels will slow things down immensely, even with algrorithmic improvements, thus the idea to migrate tasks from Gateway to Mendel.

## Proposed Next Steps
<<<<<<< HEAD
In the name of DRY, and because they will necessarily require development in tandem, next steps for Mendel have been listed in the Gateway README.
